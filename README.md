# PhoneBook
This is a phone book built using a linked list and can house five sets of data. The data is the person's first and last name as well as their email and phone number
and the city they're from. There are already four people in the phone book to populate it and the user can choose to add a new entry, remove an entry, or simply
edit an existing entry.
